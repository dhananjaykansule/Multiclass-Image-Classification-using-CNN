# Multiclass-Image-Classification-using-CNN
This project involves designing a neural network model to classify a given set of images. The dataset is split randomly, allocating 20% of the images to the training set and using the remaining 80% for testing.
Steps Included:
Model Training: The neural network is trained on the training set.
Performance Evaluation: Classification accuracy is calculated to assess the model's performance.
Result Visualization:
Display images that were correctly classified.
Show images that were misclassified.
Required Python Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
Keras
